## How to Run

This will be coming soon with final revisions

## Layout

- `/Data` - this contains all the data files, ones provied by me, and where large downloads should be placed

- `/docs` - all written documents, this includes checkpoints, and `/docs/src` contains LaTeX work before transition to ipynb notebooks for written output

- `/img` - includes source images for LaTeX output

- `/notebooks` - all notebooks containing test code, and formal runs, each should contain more supporting information

- `/util` - some utility scripts to aid in running
