\section{Research Question 1}
Can flight delays be predicted?

For this question we want a good overall look at stages of a flight, taxi, departure, landing, taxi, and arrival. The goal is to categorize if a flight will be delayed,
this is useful for airlines and people for expectations and planning around it. However there should also be an attempt at predicting the length of the delay to make 
the information more meaningful. This question will be solved with three different methods.

\subsubsection{Method 1}

The first method for this question that will be applied is logisitic regression. This method will have two possible categorical outputs, being the flight is delayed
or the flight is not delayed (Using >15m FAA definition). Logisitic regression is great for two class problems, and will fit well here.

\subsubsection{Method 2}
The second method for this question that will be applied is a random forest decision tree. This method will build an output of either delayed or not delayed. Decision trees
are great classification methods, making trees at variable splits, and can arrive at many classifications beyond two.

\subsection{Method 3}
The third method for this research question is also a random forest decision tree, but using more categorical outputs. These being our delay groups that are used in the dataset. They are not delayed, 15 minutes - 30 minutes, and builds all 15 minute increments
up to 180 minuts for a total of 12 possible groups. The power of the decision tress will allow to go beyond saying a flight is delayed or not, and offer a range following
the ranges the DOT provides.

\subsection{Data}
For the models in this research question we will provide:

Airline
Origin
Departure Block
Departure Delay
Destination
Arrival Block
Arrival Delay (Time in minutes)
Arrival Delay (True or False)
Distance 
Carrier Delay
Late Aircraft Delay
Air System Delay
Security Delay
Weather Delay

\section{Research Question 2}
What role do airports play in flight delays?

For this question focus is put on the airports themselves, focusing on only one airport we get a different scope looking at how arrivals from different ariports vary
or if they are delayed even when they depart early. This question will use much of the same methods with a more direct focus on predicting based of the airports data.

\subsubsection{Method 1}
The first method being applied for this research question is logisitic regression.

\subsubsection{Method 2}
The second method being applied for this research question is a random forest decision tree.

\subsection{Data}
For the models in this research question we will provide:
Origin
Departure Block
Departure Delay
Destination
Arrival Block
Arrival Delay (True or False)
Distance


\section{Research Question 3}
Does airport congestion make the air travel system more prone to delays?

This final question puts a focus on the operations that are not only from a flight, but time spend on the ground at the airport.

\subsubsection{Method 1}
The first method being applied for this research question is logisitic regression.

\subsubsection{Method 2}
The second method being applied for this research question is a random forest decision tree.

\subsection{Data}
For the models in this research question we will provide:
Origin
Taxi Out
Departure Block
Destination
Taxi in
Arrival Block
Arrival Delay (True or False)
