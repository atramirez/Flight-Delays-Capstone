\section{Research Question 1}
Can flight delays be predicted?

\subsubsection{Method 1}

The first method for this question that will be applied is logisitic regression. This method will have two possible categorical outputs, being the flight is delayed
or the flight is not delayed (Using >15m FAA definition).

\subsubsection{Method 2}
The second method for this question that will be applied is a random forest decision tree. This method will build an output of either delayed or not delayed.

\subsection{Method 3}
The third method for this research question is also a random forest decision tree, but using more categorical outputs. These being our delay groups that are used in the dataset. They are not delayed, 15 minutes - 30 minutes, and builds all 15 minute increments
up to 180 minuts for a total of 12 possible groups. 

\subsection{Data}
For the models in this research question we will provide:

Airline
Origin
Departure Block
Departure Delay
Destination
Arrival Block
Arrival Delay (True or False)
Distance 

\section{Research Question 2}
What role do airports play in flight delays?

\subsubsection{Method 1}
The first method being applied for this research question is logisitic regression.

\subsubsection{Method 2}
The second method being applied for this research question is a random forest decision tree.

\subsection{Data}
For the models in this research question we will provide:
Origin
Destination
Distance
Arrival Delay (True or False)


\section{Research Question 3}
Does airport congestion make the air travel system more prone to delays?

number for how much time of the delay was on the ground taxing or not being at the gate

\subsubsection{Method 1}
The first method being applied for this research question is logisitic regression.

\subsubsection{Method 2}
The second method being applied for this research question is a random forest decision tree.

\subsection{Data}
For the models in this research question we will provide:
Origin
Taxi Out
Departure Block
Destination
Taxi in
Arrival Block
Arrival Delay (True or False)
