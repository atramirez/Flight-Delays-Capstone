% Ideas for some things to condsider
% Overbooking
% Longer cancellation
% Cancelling or moving flights too much (over adjusting)

There are many ethical considerations for the tooling and analysis developed in this project looking closer at O'Hare International Airport flight delays.
Predicting flight delays is hugely beneficial to the industry, allowing for carriers to plan ahead and work towards eliminating preventable delays.
With this information though there are so problems that could arise such as delaying a flight that needs to be cancelled, prolonging the issues for the customer,
or adding more time to overall flights by over adjusting for predicted delays or moving the flight time dramatically to attempt to avoid a delay.
